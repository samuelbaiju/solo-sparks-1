![Solo Sparks Dashboard](https://res.cloudinary.com/djzbdq8p4/image/upload/v1718991307/solo_sparks_screenshot_-_dashboard.png)

## 1. Objective

Solo Sparks is a web application designed to promote self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and personal growth. It provides users with personalized "quests"â€”small, reflective activities like watching a sunset or trying a new hobby alone. By completing quests, users earn "Spark Points," which they can redeem for rewards, gamifying the journey of self-discovery.

The core mission is to help people build a stronger relationship with themselves through mindful activities and reflections.

    ```

4.  **Set up the PostgreSQL Database:**
    *   Create a new PostgreSQL database.
    *   Open `backend/solo_sparks/settings.py` and update the `DATABASES` configuration with your credentials:
        ```python
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
                'NAME': 'your_db_name',
                'USER': 'your_db_user',
                'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
                'HOST': 'localhost',
                'PORT': '5432',
