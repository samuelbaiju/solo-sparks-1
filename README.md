# Solo Sparks - Personal Growth Quest System

**Deadline:** 21 June 2025

**Frontend:** React.js

**Backend:** Django with PostgreSQL

## Feature Summary

Solo Sparks is a self-discovery feature that helps users build emotional intelligence and self-awareness through personalized activities. The system analyzes user profiles, moods, and past behaviors to suggest meaningful solo activities like "watch a sunset and reflect" or "treat yourself to dessert alone." Users complete these quests, submit reflections (text/photo/audio), earn Spark Points, and redeem rewards like profile boosts or exclusive content. It's designed to help people fall in love with themselves before finding someone else.
